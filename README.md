# Pipes

This repo serves as an example for how pipes can be used with tested working examples. 
I hope you get as much use of this as I did.

## Tests

- [x] Pipe to STDIN
- [x] Pipe to STDOUT
- [x] Pipe to STDIN & STDOUT
- [ ] Named Pipe to STDIN
- [ ] Named Pipe to STDOUT 
- [ ] Named Pipe to STDIN & STDOUT
- [ ] Named Pipe fork() -> exec()
